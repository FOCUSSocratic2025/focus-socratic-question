argument
"Hello I am an able bodied 24 year old male, about 6'1 and 205 pounds. I gotta say I've seen attack dog training videos and I'm fairly certain I could fight one off."
Preferentially caring about one part of the problem is inequitable. Feminism is often bad and unfair to men.
"We're not really a country of immigrants anymore than any other country. No group of people have stayed put in their land since the beginning of time. And yes, America has had lots of immigration in the past."
"Its a science in the broadest sense social science is a science. Im talking about hard, quantifiable, and measurable science."
"You are not obligated to help in every situation. For example, if a building is on fire, you are not obligated to run into the building to try to rescue people. There are other situations in which you would be obligated."
Well I probably agree with you more than you think. I want to make a distinction tho between conservative leaders and your average conservative voter. Maybe I'm naive but I don't think bigotry is the prime animating force for most conservative voters.
Every movement has bad seeds. Yes. But some's ideas ARE the cause of the bad seeds.
"Suppose I say ""Ability to deadlift has no correlation with strength. People who are able to run a four minute mile are much stronger than people who are excellent deadlifters."""
"When Bush II lowered taxes, tax revenues dropped. When Obama raised taxes, tax revenues increased."
The Trump administration has proven to be a criminal one. Every appointee is suspect and must at least be investigated.
"Heres the problem. Ever notice how leftists always just say raise taxes to solve money shortages? The problem is, theres only so much money you can raise."
"Of course I am referring to close friendships and not simple acquaintances. I am also referring to both parties being a combination of heterosexual, bisexual, or pansexual."
The thing is the Thor example and Black Panther example are not the same. Thor being Gay or Straight has no bearing on the character's story and identity.
"But just for the sake of discussion, what about coca leaves or opium plants? Medical morphine and codeine do exist. And can't alcohol withdrawal kill you outright? I suppose, but worst-case withdrawal symptoms is a really contrived comparison point."
My wife (26y/o) of 7 months wants to have a baby. I (25y/o) have never been crazy about kids.
"I appreciate the history background information you provided (especially ""right"" vs ""left"", I had no idea). However, I addressed your counterpoints in my OP."
"Theft is immoral by definition, though. You can't establish theft as moral."
"Okay I'll try to back up and consolidate my point. Generosity, the definition I'm using, as being the desire to give something of yours up to help someone else, when you are not compelled to, is a learned trait."
Disclaimer: I work with my hands. I don’t write shit often. My grammar is crap. The title is pretty self explanatory.
Uninspired? On what planet? Every Canadian I know is happier than every American I know.
"I’d like to mainly highlight black culture in America. I am not racist, because I don’t care about their skin color. Although, black American culture is a harmful culture."
"Because you're conflating ""family"" with ""reproduction"". You're changing the question the child actually asked (about reproduction) into one you prefer to answer and are more comfortable answering (about family)."
"And what ""necessary"" separation are you talking about? What is necessary about keeping a girl away from boys while camping or doing projects for their community? Girls have plenty of girl only spaces and the few boy only spaces boys have are being attacked and taken away."
Yes. Storage should be part of training requirements at the very least I also think the federal government could incentivize the purchase of gun safes so more people buy them. Maybe offer tax credits or subsidize the cost of purchase.
"I agree, I’m not saying we nullify the federal government. I’m saying for hot button issues (abortion, gun laws, drug laws, etc.)"
The NSA violated the 4th amendment. Snowden simply exposed their illegal activities.
You're not the first person here to get hung up on the word 'need' and ignoring the rest. You can't walk into a building and kill a crowd of people with expensive clothing.
"I'm not so sure I did. You are choosing to redefine your OP, not me."
"So, I think the question at stake here is really—body autonomy. Let’s look at something different: food allergies. Let’s say I have a peanut allergy."
"We can look at the rest of the animal kingdom for counterexamples. For example, if you look at a transparent animal like the glass frog, you'll see red blood vessels."
"Nope, all of them. Pride parades, pro-life parades, gun parades, etc."
You talk about my definition and then some other constructed person with the same second person address. I was honestly starting to feel attacked and would have gotten super pissed if I hadn't been mainly confused.
Supporting veterans means supporting war. War is rape torture and pain.
"The state of education in America varies since the quality of schools at the secondary level is based on prop. tax. Thus, you can have rich schools with amazing resources and you can have poor schools which have few resources to offer their students."
"Ah so the holocaust was just a small bump on the way or what? Also ""most powerful empire on Earth"" is laughable at best."
"Maybe I can give insight into how we talk about VAT in Europe. Generally we say our VAT in Austria is 20%, or 19% in Germany for example."
Secular ones fail. Look at Communism and Marxism which is militantly anti-religion.
Basically the title. The love of guns in the United States is too deeply ingrained in the minds of her citizens.
I assumed US because I specified my argument in the main comment to the US and its political discourse. I never said I find flying the flag offensive.
I want to spend time with my friends too. I don't want to just be sitting home alone.
I believe the choices we make in how we present ourselves to others does reflect how we want to be perceived. How I want to be perceived I feel relies heavily on my personality.
You can still do face to face with no mask with your loved ones? You can wear a mask and be more distant when you are at work or doing groceries or whatever.
"White people, at their best, have no ill will towards black folks but their refusal to acknowledge or ignorance of systematic racism is not helping black people. Other minorities seem to want to be as white as possible which is sad for them because white is NOT the standard."
I'd say its fairly easy to imagine a situation in which 2 men might have the same problem. Even with a 180 lb man.
"Since copyright is enforced in civil court, there is basically no incentive to sue someone with no money. So there is a sort of de-facto fair use for small time artists who aren't worth suing."
All people equal. However most women aren't brought up to be tough. Men are without a scientific doubt overall physically stronger and bigger. So a female assaulted by a man is heinous.
"Yes, but in prison, you can, in theory, learn from your actions and become a better person. In hell, you will never redeem yourself, and are tortured forever."
Comparisons with what happened to the native americans really annoy me. There's just a minor difference between 'immigration' and 'invasion and genocide'.
"Personally, I'm opposed to the death penalty. But I find your arguments uncompelling. Here's why: Innocent people have been convicted and executed. Irrelevant. Innocent people have also been convicted and served 20, 30, 40 or more years in prison."
I'm assuming you're a woman. From the point of view of a regular guy 1.
"Let's start with the freedoms outlined in the Constitution. Our Constitutional rights don't include ""access to cheap oil""."
Not saying one way is better than the other. My point is blaming a problem on an entity not in practice is not accurate.
No. Liberals aren't justified to be angry to Trump supporters. To be angry at trump supporters is utterly pointless.
Traditional sexual preferences are biology based. You would be attracted to an opposite or same gender/sex.
Have you ever disagreed with a progressive about tenants of their ideology around race and identity? Its pretty clear progressives are similarly narrow minded.
"yes, but here’s the thing. after i heard her tell her story, i entirely understood why."
"There's also nothing inherently black about dying from hanging, but a lot of them coincidentally got hung back in the day. Just because you can point out a middle step doesn't mean the issue doesn't still predominantly affect one race."
I think your overstating the positive feelings of the onlookers. Being entertained doesnt even compare to the inverse of being tortured.
"I think where we get to the level of groups of shareholders, there's a disconnect for me. To me, individuals have rights."
I'm going to assume you're talking about a cultural/societal form of censorship and not a legal one. You have to think about what the purpose of art is.
"Not at all. Because of how humans work, any correlation gets treated as causation. A hypothetical biased but not explicitly “racist” observer will see a black person and assume they’re poor, and therefore more violent, less educated, etc."
"the technological advances humanity has made (and will make), everyone can be provided the basic necessities required to live a productive life. Where there is a will, there is a way, as they say. You are making a huge assumption."
I can demand more money then. I feel like I'm compensated very well for my work. I also understand that the employer taking most of the risk operating a huge business investing in the infrastructure c demands more than the replaceable workers.
"But you are following a list of instructions, just one that is so extremely long and complex and everchanging that it doesn't seem as such. Your entire consciousness if a result of a network of neurons firing on and off."
"I got the terms wrong but doesn't change the facts what I am trying to say. All the participates were from from a retirement peoplAmericans ages 50 and older"" These participants were, on average, 66.51 (SD = 10.04) years olde study.... They only ask old people the questions."
"No, you are making the claim that 50% of cops are bad. That is 400,000 individuals. You can’t make that statement and then proceed to tell me to prove you wrong."
"Like I said, it’s all about the intentions. My husband isn’t a gold digger because he didn’t marry me for money."
"Here's the real world problem with legalized prostitution. In many places where it is legal, sex slavery thrives and the victims are typically impoverished foreign women or underaged or drug addicts."
I see. I guess I am a bit of a shithead. But anyway so you're saying there's a double standard.
"Individual behavior is quite literally the farthest possible thing from ""systematic"" that you can get. Any trends in individual behavior that you are assigning as ""systematic racism"" again, can be easily explained by one of the several dozen other possibilities that are available."
I believe British colonialism was a net good. It spread a lot of knowledge. It rooted liberalism in the west to put it on the path to where it is now.
"1. Vegetables, fruit 2. I'm sure there's plenty of companies that avoid using palm oil, people just have to look for them"
Are you here in good faith to try and have your ideas changed? Yes But you're dismissing my point without reason.
Can it be objectively true that Chris both - hates apples - does not have apples ? Absolutely not. But objectively false =/= not objectively true.
"At this point, war may be the better alternative. Imo, the main reason China isnt going around the world conquering people by force, is because the US military exists."
"We're talking about social issues only here. When discussing social issues only, there are many more political philosophies than just libertarianism that want to prohibit infringing on rights involving social issues."
None of you are thinking creatively. I disagree with this assertion a great deal. I think you are hugely optimistic about what industrialized nations can do for a huge influx of uneducated poor migrants that don't speak their language.
"Not in morality, no. Morality is a fiction, invented by humans."
"Am I, though? I always thought of permission as something I needed to expressly give. Me just occupying an area is not implied permission for someone to do something to me."
I'll expand on a previous argument that I posed. Lazy people are likely to give up something they want if it becomes too difficult to obtain.
Physical land has value because it’s scarce That’s not true at all. Scarcity is only part of the value of land.
I regularly see non-Americans complain about people assuming everyone on Reddit is American. My view is that it makes sense to assume that the average Redditor is American.
"They'd hold that they're jumping to conclusions, but that's a much different claim than they're incorrect. Furthermore, based on the history of racism in the US, and its current effects on society up to the present day, it's perfectly reasonable to suspect racism to be a factor in these shootings."
"You really don't seem to understand the world's condition right now. No shit my argument doesn't work under normal circumstances, that's why I'm using it during a global pandemic."
"But the reasons have to be viewed in context. Yes, planets are common but that's like someone arguing that a grain of sand will suddenly become sentient."
It once took me a month and a half to figure out if an internship was paid or not. It's not a question of stupidity when they were actively trying to obfuscate.
"No, I live under a rock. But seriously, to imply that socioeconomic disadvantage is any impediment to intelligence is wildly racist, and I'm not sure what you're getting at."
"An analogy doesn't map onto a solution, an analogy is a way of looking at an issue. You clearly suggested that white oppression is the terminus of that line of thinking, and that's your interpretation of a solution."
"If we find a way to explain it, it will no longer be unexplainable. But until then why assume it has a reasonable explanation? If all known means of gathering information fail, why would you assume that one day you'll make one that won't? That's what I meant by arrogance."
"Now, I should preface this with saying that I don't believe that everybody should earn exactly the same. I just don't think anybody deserves to be, say, a multimillionaire. The reasons for this are as follows: People often put several reasons forward for someone being deserving of their wealth."
"I think it's a fair assumption to make that if one species has been by our part of space, then many have. And many space-faring species would leave some kind of mark."
"I suppose you are correct - it doesn't really make it a public forum. However, my point still stands that it makes no sense for a site to have the protection of an site that simply hosts content if they are actively editing things."
"My assumption is that in a reality that this pill existed, that doctors would highly recommend taking the pill for a period of time before considering surgical options. Doubtful, since as mentioned above it raises all sorts of ethical questions about changing who the patient is as a person."
"The West is crippled by suicidal altruism. China has a population of over 1.3B and is still 93% ethnically Han Chinese. Meanwhile, White Western nations like the US, France, and England, all have projections for when they will become minority White."
Nah. I can easily see why someone would do that on religious grounds. Adults are on their own. They've sinned and they will be judged on their actions when they die.
That contributes nothing the argument. It does not change the fact that discrepancies have happened in sports with trans competitors.
"But magical flying voodoo dragons can exist. Just kidding, you're right, the evidence argument was nonsense, my appologies. But my major claim is still the same, chemical reactions and matter don't explain free will, so something else should."
Maybe circular is the wrong word. But all your arguments about “consent” and “responsibility” aren’t arguments against abortion.
"Broken window fallacy doesn't apply in just any case where you're comparing opportunity costs. It's about stimulating the economy without any other side benefit. It doesn't apply to creating a new industry, and absolutely cannot apply to science. I'm not sure if I can explain it any simpler."
"Writing the same thing over and over again doesn't actually count as proof. You haven't even remotely substantiated your claim that waiters in higher end restaurants know their menus better, are more knowledgable about alcohol pairings, etc."
"But should feminism be about gender equality or egalitarianism? For me, “gender equality” is a movement that totally leaves behind most women and most men. Equality assumes that the system for men is working and the only issue is that women don’t have equal access to the system."
I would say we don't know which way results in intelligent life the fastest. But if extinction events help create intelligent life then maybe there is a planet out there that had more than us and developed intelligent life faster that way.
"Sure it is. The OP makes a LOT of assumptins, as I have shown many of those assumptions are, at best guesses - and things can EASILY turn out differently Without those assumptions OP argument falls apart."
Lol fuck this argument. The government ducks everything up so instead let's give it to the better (????)
"I'm saying no penalty should be awarded to anyone. It's fucking insane. Human interaction cannot be curbed by ""political correctness."" Nobody was right or wrong in this situation, both parties are guilty of stupid shit."
"Did these illnesses cause obesity before certain specific foods were introduced into society in certain ways? Like I said, I understand there may be a few rare exceptions, but I think it's more harmful to exclude people who can do it than to accidentally include people who can't."
It sounds like the type of evidence and studies you would like are impossible to produce unless we had 2 identical countries that couldn’t interact and one had patents and the other didn’t. At some point you have to judge things on theory as trying it in practice is too destructive and harmful.
"Just a reminder that Al Gore isn't and never was a climate scientist. The predictions of actual professionals have always been less sensationalist, more evidence based and, yes, also more accurate than the headlines one tends to read in the press."
i just don't understand why people would do such a dangerous thing to themselves and call it an improvement. Neuralink is a technology in which you plug computer processors into your brain and have your brain connected to the internet.
America desperately needs a young president and it’s gonna be my single issue in 2024. The choices we have this cycle have only reinforced my opinions. An old person can’t lead this country the right way without being a puppet (which Biden will be to his VP selection).
A similar CMV was here a few days ago. For many animal ethicists it's not so much about animal welfare as it's abour the lack of consent.
If we were to treat the space race as a race it doesn't matter if you pass all the mile markers first what matters is that you pass the finish line first. It seems that a manned moon landing was the finish line.
"Well some would say both are problems. Secondly, the audience is filled with the marginalised and privileged both, normally."
"I would say that something is true if it corresponds to reality. If two people have different mutually exclusive interpretations of something, one or both must be false."
"It's ladders because guys have one ladder girls have two. Guys have girls on their ladder, and the would-fuck and friend are fairly parallel, and all the girls are on his same ladder."
Deciding that it better to have a POC over a white person for no reason other than that I'd prejudice. What do you think I is? It's making assumptions based on race.
"particularly if the West supported Nationalist China How much support are we talking? Nukes certainly won't work, too much collateral and civilian damage. If its ground troops, then its going to be a much worse version of Vietnam."
"Trendy psychology suggests it is possible for a ""Woman"" to be born in the body of a man. Please give me an argument that cannot apply to any of the following cases."
That would be interesting. But our government doesn't publish those statistics.
"I'm not arguing that they do exist, but rather that, the more you think about it from the rational skeptic point of view, the more it makes sense to be agnostic about them. Sure, I find their existence extremely improbable. But impossible? No. So I suspend my final judgment somewhat."
"Sorry, but I’m not sure I know which questions you mean. Mind asking them again. And yes, when I say objective, I mean “not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts”."
Little to nothing of what you described is actually cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is not white people in braids. Cultural appropriation is white people hopping around in a circle doing a rain dance in what can only be described as an absolute mockery of Native American culture.
"I actually do watch a lot of international news, more than American actually. French newscasters always say ""Trahmpe"". Russian newscasters consistently say ""Syi Tsyin'pyin""."
Because there is a difference between worshiping a god worshiping nature. I also think there's a difference between religion spirituality.
"Yeah...you missed like, everything. The title I’ve made is crap and misleading so I had to elaborate in my opening statement."
"Because not being mentally weak does not mean mentally impenetrable. If you watch your best friends get viciously murdered in front of you, you're going to be left with trauma. And read what i said about tech again."
"Paraphrased from the Blade Runner 2049 quote. If you look at the great superpowers of human history, e.g."
"No. A person is defined, if not by anything else, by their choices. Baseline respect - Normal. Chooses to volunteer - Good. Respect increased Chooses to be a giant jerk - Bad. Respect decreased. The particulars of the job shouldn't affect the reasoning, is what I think."
"Unless you are a young actor, you shouldn't be doing advertisements. Letting someone buy something as personal as the emotions conveyed in songs to help sell a product is wrong, and the art is no longer as genuine."
"I should correct my wording. Trashy here is taken to mean closer to ""abnormal"" as in outside the norm."
"A logical emotional appeal does not exist. Appeal to emotions actually is a fallacy, but argument from emotion isn't."
"Obviously. But I know what you mean. I don't think I used the right phrasing, because I am arguing from a moral perspective."
"For reference, I am a 19 year old currently attending university. I’m studying a stem degree, and In three years (statistically), I should be able to find a job in my field."
I think you didn't read my post. Current rental properties would be bought out by the state and rented out by the state.
"I do see a difference between them because everyone may be exposed to and subconsciously accept bigoted views due to exposure from the environment. Bigotry is learned, not innate."
I don't think patents should exist at all. There are better ways to encourage innovation
"Multigenerational aristocratic families are super rare. So are mass murders, but we should never stop trying to stamp them out."
"I'd say the standards of the country certainly do matter. Lets compare a potential family living in the US and one living in some nomadic tribe in Africa or something. For the former, being able to afford having a child should involve questions about how you can support their healthcare costs."
Look at infomaps of the United States. Any measurable metric of success north is better than the south.
"Just to be clear appetite is also psychological. 6'3"" person with lots of med school. I can certainly eat most people under the table. But I'm currently at around 1000 calories a day."
"A legal right isn't a philosophical right. In the US, individuals have a legal right to own arms at the national level, and the state level (2010)."
"You hear incorrectly. Once you're registered to vote, you're registered."
"The entire history of humans consist of humans banding together in ever-increasing groups for mutual profit. I agree totally. What role, if any, does empathy play? I believe I made my case."
Many people who are big into science claim to never use faith. But there is always some fundamental element of faith in whatever you do.
I'm confused as to what you're saying here. Objective and subjective are mutually exclusive.
Its really simple. People do care and want to do something but the responsibility ultimately falls on you the business owner and the rich first.
You are making more money now than you did 20 years ago. The average pay increase has outstripped the average oil cost increase.
"Again, illegal is not a noun except when used as a slur. If you don't want people to think you are a racist, don't use slurs."
"who doesn't? Outside of office jobs, almost all corporate office work requires a dress shirt + tux."
"Once again, facts don't care about your feelings. I will not purposefully humiliate you (which is why I will call you what you want to be called in private) , but I am going to be using the correct terms for your gender when publicly speaking to others."
You missed the most obvious explanation: easy access to information contradicting the religious teachings. Religion conforming to personal beliefs has been a thing since the beginning of religion.
What proof did you give? You just said I was wrong.
"Language is meant to convey meaning. Indeed. And the words: ""Freedom of Speech"" only have one meaning."
"Well let’s assume we are dealing with a moral, educated, and enlightened population for argument sake. The US literally had part of their population wanting to secede to maintain slavery."
"""Slenderman"", ""Sonic.EXE"", ""Jeff the Killer"", ""Ben Drowned"", doesn't matter. Every single creepypasta I have ever encountered is terribly written, have overused cliches, and only ever rely on shock value."
Nazis and Nazi sympathizers believe in genocide and mass violence as policy goals. Punching a Nazi is always self defense because their ideology of Nazism constitutes a direct threat of violence.
"I would just get on the coat tails of the other guy and say your definition is wrong about a 'game'. Rules, objective, and a win scenario is what makes a game a game."
"I consider myself a libertarian and therefore am fiscally conservative. However, given the debates over the tax code overhaul, I truly believe we need to go back to the days of capital gains being treated the same as ordinary income."
Not really no. My definition is policies within the system having the goal of producing as much sustainable profit as possible. The meritocratic/needs of the public is a side effect.
The IRS doesn't enforce laws unrelated to tax violations. You can (and should!) even file illegal income to the irs.
Answer my question directly. The army absolutely listened to the king and carried out his orders.
"Gyms: a space where sweaty men go to look attractive to and for other men There's a massive difference between finding someone attractive, and being (sexually or romantically) attracted to them. Being gay is about men feeling a sexual and/or romantic attraction to other men."
"I grew up on a farm. Animals are either useful for work, or edible. We often handraised calves, turned them into pets. Pigs, chickens, birds, rabbits."
"Nachos, to me, are a snack or an appetizer. I've been seeing my friends getting really into the idea of eating a giant plate of nachos or a nacho bar as a meal."
"Personal property is an invention of one man to oppress another man and is supported only by propaganda and violence, not by some ontological state of ""property-ness."" As an idea, or a platonic form, property does not exist."
"In your example presumably the king was king merely by bloodline, there is no freedom among the people to choose their leader. Ability to choose ones leader has nothing to do with freedom."
"Slippery slope fallacy. Just because I'm in favor of cutting hateful subs out of reddit doesn't mean I'm in favor of actual censorship or ""nerve [stapling] everyone who disagrees."""
"In my opinion, a world with piece and is impossible to exist. The world never was, in not and never will be peacefull."
"Actually, yes I am. If I could be monogamous, I would. I certainly tried. Now, there are some people who can only be monogamous."
I think its wayy better. arranged marriage means low divorce from many studies. less divorce among parents means less trauma in kids.
"Gender is a social construct, defined by the way a person relates with society. If gender did not exist, one could not be transgender. However, one could still have dysphoria, which is not a social construct, but a demonstrable medical condition."
"I agree with you generally, however, the ""versions"" are absolutely the same for both animals and humans. The dose is different and the approved clinical applications may be different but the active pharmaceutical ingredient is absolutely the same and often times produced at the same facility."
"So now you're changing your definition. In OP you stated ""you don't have ovaries"" etc not ""you never had ovaries"" what if a transwoman had ovaries implanted"
How does the sharpie example refute my statement? I said stopped just as easily as someone with a pen. Stopping someone with a pen would be hard because of the same idea as the knife.
"Theology is the study of the divine. Science is a process for determining what is and isn't true. So obviously, a theologian could use science to study the divine."
"Faith is the belief in something with an absence of evidence. We definitely do not ""all have faith in something."""
"Oh the quality of living here (Europe) is much better IMO. I immigrated two years ago and you couldn’t pay me to go back to the US. And yes, I know Europe is big and varied but I have family and friends all over enough for many aspects to be tangible."
"To open first I'll tell you about myself. So, I'm an intersex female I was artificially assigned male at birth by force with the use of stem cells. I identify with four of the sexes I will list below."
"So, here's the thing: men calling women bitch has come with beatings in the past. White people calling black people slurs have come with beatings and deaths in the past."
"Yes, if you were to look at the ""bell curve"" of people with degrees you're going to find people who have a lot of degrees and no income. All the more reason to base the relief on income and ability to repay."
Biden has literally decades of history of being a middle of the road democrat. Trump has 4 years of history of eroding pretty much every American institution and massively messing up a response to a pandemic.
I've not brought any benefits up. We're still talking about your refusal to inform yourself on subjects you wish to hold views on.
"Specifically speaking for the United States. If you're opposed to implementing some form of universal healthcare, I am curious as to what the rationale is."
"I have considered every viewpoint giving to me in a reply, but I can honestly say I have not been swayed. I have studied human history seen the stupid selfish things we have done to each other."
"First: Notice the ""and"". Obviously, some subs need to limit one or the other due to the sub's function."
"What does basic care cover? Basic care should not allow someone to rack up a $100,000 bill and not pay a dime."
"The specific points I am thinking of include: The continued occupation of the Guantanamo Bay base (itself a can of worms) and ignoring repeated requests of the Cuban government to withdraw from the base. The embargo, which disproportionately hurts poorer Cubans and not the elite."
"Lol, the politician with the most demonstrated integrity is lying? If you total up all of the US taxes, sales, property, federal, medicaid, etc, then add in what we pay for Healthcare, we're not far off from Nordic rates."
I actually think my idea is better than our current system on count 2. Maybe court-mandated rehabilitation during a probationary period after the punishment could be used.
Morality is a useless drain on politics. A government's sole purpose is to help people and all morality does is get in the way.
"No, I've never tried going on a field week with 25kg packing and a rifle and ammo. I've never had to sustain one meal a day with little water and a couple hours of sleep."
"No. Skeletal is one difference among many. Not just skeletal density but also skeletal strutcure. Bigger hips vs bigger shoulders, hands, etc."
"Whenever there is a major economic disaster (as opposed to the natural kinds), financial fear can spread quickly and cause consumers to scale back spending. Cash flow dries up and the economy grinds to a halt."
I really want you to get your way and we disarm everyone except criminals. You'd still find a reason to blame the guns.
Wealth = products produced. So if you just added a zero to every dollar.
"Student debt in America has reached $1.4 trillion shared amongst over 40 million people, with the average debt being over $30,000. So many colleges are handing out worthless degrees for $250K a pop and leaving their graduates unemployed and with crippling debt."
I will be able to pass without putting effort into the classes. Yes I just intend to get the loans until the bank cuts me off.
Unethical activities need to be proven. Accusations shouldn't be given the weight and spotlight of verdicts.
"I believe in a violent overthrow of capitalism, the state and the ruling classes. My ideology follows the society outlined in ""The Conquest if Bread"" by Pyotr Kropotkin (my personal hero)."
"No no, most men have the same view. I don't directly ask them for sex. I ask them for drinks/dinner two times max."
So I've been having a conversation with my 2 friends and we seem to have really different ideas. I'll explain the scenario and context.
Not at all. Mental illnesses are not a choice in any way. Addiction is a choice. You can choose not to do drugs.
Biologically our purpose is to reproduce but I think our purpose in life is to be happy. Everything we do is in pursuit of a better life.
"We are not set up biologically to eat a diet of strictly plant/vegetable matter. Morality of what we eat should not be the issue here, but more the practices of how we obtain the meat we eat. Morality comes into play when you look at factory farms and the conditions in which animals are raised."
Not at all. I would prefer if Congressman were only permitted to have mutual funds.
I dont agree. racial preferences for dating and marrying are heavily rooted in societal expectations and standards of beauty.
Yes. As OP pointed out my hypothetical scenario is impractical and unrealistic and I agree with cutting the losses. But in an ideal world the hypothetical mother should have to pay.
"Carriers could be required to do some minimal vetting. For example, any call originating from Vanuatu should have the correct country code."
Here in the US both Chambers of the legislature are already so undemocratic . Allowing them to pick the executive would be a disaster.

"Not gonna say “only in cases of rape or health.” Not gonna say abortion is good thing, either. In fact, abortion is a terrible, terrible thing."
Way to dodge the point and make baseless accusations. Please address the point on truckers.
Your logic is unsound. Say OP can save 10 lives by killing themselves and donating their organs.
"Eh, no, I'm not removing ALL negative aspects. Possible miscalculation of intelligence is always possible, ethicality of limiting offspring rights...."
"I think you have me confused with someone else but I'll answer anyway. You think gender is a sexist notion and should be done away with, right? No. Gender roles are social construct and arbitrary. Gender identity is innate and internal."
Now here me out before you comment. There really really nothing bad about eating dog meat.
Elections have consequences. The common good is my claim.
"Someone having a ton of capital not circulating in the system doesn’t cause inflation. You’re thinking of the very outdated quantity theory of money, but you also got the velocity of money backwards"

"No. Absolutely not ""the government"". By community I mean the individuals in the relevant community."

"No population is fully vaccinated, first of all. Secondly, outbreaks are often the result of a new strain of virus. Vaccines are generally a reactive development, designed to prevent future outbreaks of the same strain."
"I have a rather simple approach to weight loss: if you are overweight (i.e. carrying too much body fat), then all you really have to do to lose weight is eat less. If you don't eat enough, your body will consume your fat reserves."
"All I said was moving requires money, Okay. So get more money. Get a second job live below your means sell shit."
The 2021 budget for the US is about 6.8 trillion. The top 100 billionaire range from ~$130B to $18B. On a rough average let's say $75B x 100 is $7.5T. So even if we took 100% of there wealth we may be able to solve our problems for a year.
"America is one of the freest places on earth. However, even in America, I see humans being bound by Ideologies and dogma."
Preface: I support feminism and as a doctrine as well as the pro-life movement. Feminism is a movement to push the doctrine of equality between men and women.
I draw the line where the beliefs of one group encroach upon the rights of others. Not printing an image of Muhammad is not violating any of my rights.

"Consistently wrong is still wrong, and you are demonstrably and provably wrong about the nature of vaccination on a societal level. Vaccines are like 90% about the protection of the collective and maybe 10% about an individual...individually."
What an absurd worldview. Marriage actually is very valuable in the current day. Legal protections afforded by marriage are very valuable.
"Abuse requires intent. Your view is factually incorrect, as the most you could argue for when a parent is not aware of the effects of at least not intentionally making their child obese is to charge them with neglect."

Some combination of business/govt policies. Just because there are poor people doesn’t mean you have to take from the rich.
"Setting goals and achieving them are generally considered a worthwhile thing in society. Physical people are set and strive for goals. e.g. Plan, train and run a marathon within a certain time."

"Burning large quantities of gasoline pollutes the air. Consuming large quantities of soda, alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes increases public healthcare costs. Products like theses should come with a large sales tax."
The proper lens to look at anything is with no lens. We need to evaluate everything being objective and using reason.

I will argue the first sentence you have written. There is absolutely no right to life.
"Sigh People are bad with empathy. Hi, I'm a lesbian. I'd be pretty offended if a stereotypical butch/lumberjack lesbian costume was a normal thing to wear on Halloween."
"Oh, ok? I'm not sure what our disagreement is."
You know how we treated Nazis? We killed millions of them and then prosecuted their leaders we didn't kill for crimes against humanity. You are being hyperbolic for comparing treatment of the Trump administration to the treatment of Nazis.

"Yet, women are more likely to attempt suicide. Attempting suicide is not similar to actual suicide."

"Civics should be mandatory. Knowing how to parse political issues is important. However, having a class where teachers cover present-day political debate is a terrible idea."

"What we are witnessing right now is the changing of the guard. Economically, China is already a power nobody else can live without."
Meh. I don’t think so. Believing a man can be a woman is as dumb as believing a black guy can be a white guy in my opinion.
What part of the bible do you think supports the inequality of women ? The coming of Jesus invalidates the old testament.
Racism harms the race is targets of course. Playing devils advocate allows me to strengthen the argument if need be.

"True, we may have to eat them (vegetarianism is difficult to undertake(?) if you're not prepared), but if animals' lives have any value whatsoever, then we out to feel guilt for what we've done."
On the contrary. Opinion without hard evidence can be completely valid.
thats like saying the n word the word cracker are the same. do you guys ever get sick of pretending white people experience systematic racism
"Ethics, there are different ethical perspectives and motivations. Killing an animal doesn't strike me as inherently unethical."
But there are other factors to their being more deaths in car crashes. Agreed. And there are more factors in the world of international violence and terrorism than just NSA spying.

I mean, George Bush never got charged for his war crimes, and Trump is out here trying to get away with the most obvious crimes possible, awarding himself huge government contracts, blatant nepotism, and very clearly abusing power."
"Your second premise is false. If there is a non tea pot God, there can still be a tea pot god IN ADDITION to non tea pot God. Your third premise is also false."

No. Personally I am an organ donor. But people have the right to keep their body intact after death.
Can I hear a more in depth argument as to why a regional EC would be better? One of the few things holding us back from abolishing the EC is people’s obsession w states rights.
"Sounds reasonable in the moment. Just wondering - what do you expect in the longer term? A situation where the police can't enforce the law is, by common understanding, not a democracy but an anarchy."
Phone companies don't interrupt your call or text with advertisements either. Social media companies are advertising companies.
What numbers have exponentially increased? People have kids for a lot of reasons.
Alt-right is an insult. Id be happier if you didnt assume i was evil. And arent you the one failing to have a substantive dialogue? Look how far off track we've gotten.
